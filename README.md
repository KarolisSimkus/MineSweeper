# Minesweeper (C++ Terminal Version)

A simple terminal-based Minesweeper clone implemented in C++.
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, and basic procedural game logic.
## 🎮 How to Play
Once the program starts, the board appears:
```
<---x--->
[ ][0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]
[0][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*]
[1][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*][*]
...
```
Enter commands in this format:

y x r   → reveal cell  
y x f   → flag cell  
q       → quit  

Example: 

3 4 r

## 🧠 Features

❌ Random mine placement

🚩 Reveal & flag functionality

💯 Automatic scoring of neighboring cells

🏳️ Win if all mines are flagged

🏴‍☠️ Lose if a mine is revealed

OOP architecture (inheritance, abstract classes, factories)
## Running
Download the cpp and use your cpp compiler to compile ( I didn't use cmake 'cause this was my first ever project:p)
